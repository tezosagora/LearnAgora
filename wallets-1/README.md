# Wallets

A **cryptocurrency wallet** is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the [public and/or private keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and can be used to track ownership, receive or spend [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). 

It should be noted that the cryptocurrency itself is not in the wallet. In the case of Tezos and cryptocurrencies derived from it, the cryptocurrency is decentrally stored and maintained in a publicly available [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) called the [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The wallet is merely an interface to interact with the chain, and you can move freely between them provided they operate by similar standards. You are not usually restricted to the wallet with which you created your account.

There are a number of Tezos wallets available for each platform below:
